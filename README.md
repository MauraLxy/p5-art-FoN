# What my artwork is
My monster is called Fairy of Nature(FoN), which is like a Hermes, a herald[6], of Nature. FoN has a round body and a pair of wings. The movement of FoN's body is controlled by checking the 'frameCount' variable while its wings also applies 'random()' and 'rotate()' function. 'If' statement is to arrange the limit of its movement and order of different elements. I also use 'push()' and 'pop()' function to limit the range and a help fairyMove() function to simplify my code.

# What it means
FoN, as a messenger of Nature, includes five colors representing: brown-tree trunk/root, cornsilk-fruit/harvest, light blue-sky, green-life, deep blue-ocean.
The purpose of this work is actually to comfort my sorrow of extinct species. I choose thylacine as a representative of all the extinct creatures. The death of the world's last thylacine 'Benjamin' is due to careless exposure to sunburn in Hobbart Zoo[7], which is the core of my work: when Benjamin reaches his end, FoN is sent by Nature; Benjamin tells FoN that he's tired and FoN flies up, smiling at him, telling him it's ok and Benjamin then closes his eyes and his soul will follow FoN back to Nature's arms.
